# MultiShiner
Copyright &copy; 2015 Bart and Benjamin Massey

This KiCAD project is a tiny circuit board with a Silicon
Labs EFM8BB10 microcontroller and not much else. The board
is intended to be put into the arm of a GameCube controller,
where it intercepts the data flowing between the controller
and the cube. With the proper software, the board can be
made to "multi-shine" the Smash Brothers Melee character
"Fox" when a newly-added pushbutton switch on the side of
the controller is pressed.

The project is in the early stages. The hardware is not
finished; the software is nonexistent.

Working with this project requires a recent (post-stable)
version of KiCAD.
